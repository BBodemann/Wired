# TAO (The Anon Operation): unstoppable free speech
An app to facilitate unstoppable free speech on the internet.

## Overview
Nostr at the core: censorship resistant, also stupid simple and permissionless <br/>
Anon only: Names and Nyms carry reputations/ego and risk doxxing - Anons speak freely <br/>
PoW: Spam and noise

### Wanting to add

Ways to make Nostr notes impossible to stop? <br/>
- Secure Scuttlebutt gossip and offline (?): Even in locked down countries, if we have a SSB-like medium, we only need one person to connect to a relay to share other ppl's messages<br/>
- Extremely lightweight relays and gossiping <br/>
- PWAs and bridges: A proliferation of similar, simple PWAs, and the sharing of notes through any means (telegram, email, pigeon) before getting to nostr <br/>
- API connection to do PoW externally to app if wanted
